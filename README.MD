<!-- INSPIRATION -->
## Inspiration

We were inspired by games like Kahoot and Gimkit that make learning fun by turning it into a game.

<!-- WHAT IT DOES -->
## What It Does

The stemBOT is a bot that asks the user questions on the topic they have picked. Here are some of the features:
* User can pick different topics for the quiz
* User can see real time scores (after each question)
* User can skip if they don't know the answer.
* User can also see final score after the quiz is over

<!-- HOW WE BUILT IT -->
## How We Built It

We built this bot using Discord and Replit. Discord is our User Interface (UI) and Replit is where we put the backend logic. For the backend, we wrote the code in python.

<!-- CHALLENGES WE RAN INTO -->
## Challenges We Ran Into

* We were unfamiliar with discord and github platforms. So, we had to get familar with the interfaces before starting the coding
* The bot is an event driven program.So, we had to make sure the user's state is preserved across multiple questions.
* We had to develop logic to ignore small typos and case sensitivity in the answers.

<!-- ACCOMPLISHMENTS WE ARE PROUD OF -->
## Accomplishments We Are Proud Of

We're proud to have developed a versatile tool that can be easily integrated into any Discord server, empowering users to engage in educational quizzes on a variety of subjects. This was our first time ever creating a Discord Bot and we successfully were able to run it. We also customized the bot so users can input a subject of their choice, and the bot quizzes them accordingly, fostering learning and engagement within the server.

<!-- WHAT WE LEARNED -->
## What We Learned

We learned to navigate through platforms such as Discord, Github, and Replit to create our bot. We also learned more in software development, by learning new ways to implement features into the bot by learning new code. We learned how to add our bot to any Discord Server and how to manage bugs in the program.

<!-- WHAT IS NEXT FOR STEMBOT POWERED UP USING DISCORD -->
## What Is Next For StemBOT Powered Up Using Discord

For now the StemBOT only has two subjects (with six questions each) programmed into it. In futre, we would like to
* Extend it by adding more subjects and questions.
* Make it more fun and more gamelike - example: introduce leaderboard.
